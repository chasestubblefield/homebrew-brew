# homebrew-personal
This a [Homebrew Tap][https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/brew-tap] containing a collection of "formulae" I either do not intend to submit to the canonical repository or have not been accepted yet. I use it for installing my own executables and other random packages.

## Usage

"Tap" this repo to be able to use these formula:

```bash
brew tap chasetopher/personal
```

Then you can install formula without a prefix:

```bash
brew install git-status-line
```

Alternatively, you can reference specific formula and the repository will be tapped for you:

```bash
brew install chasetopher/personal/git-status-line
```
